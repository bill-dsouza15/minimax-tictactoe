# Web-based Tic-Tac-Toe using Minimax algorithm for Computer moves

I created this project for understanding and demonstrating the use of Minimax algorithm for game AI decisions. I chose tic-tac-toe due to its popularity and simplicity.

Idea:
* The url lands you on a page where you choose between either X or O. Selecting "X" lets you play first and selecting "O" lets the computer play first.
* Upon making your choice you are redirected to the game page where you play the classic tic-tac-toe game against the computer (Minimax algorithm).
* When a round ends, you can choose to continue the round streak by playing the next match or restart the game from round 1.
